0,1351123200,B003XPF9BO,A3R7JR3FMEBXQB,5,where does one  start...and stop... with a treat like this,Wanted to save some to bring to my Chicago family but my North Carolina family ate all 4 boxes before I could pack. These are excellent...could serve to anyone
1,1351123200,B003JK537S,A3JBPC3WFUT5ZP,1,Arrived in pieces,"Not pleased at all. When I opened the box, most of the rings were broken in pieces. A total waste of money."
2,1351123200,B000JMBE7M,AQX1N6A51QOKG,4,"It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .","I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange.""  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference."
3,1351123200,B004AHGBX4,A2UY46X0OSNVUQ,3,These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.,"I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.  There are 7 nice big chunks in every jar.<br /><br />These taste like tuna in a can but, because they're preserved in glass, you don't have to worry about either aluminum or BPA; BUT ... they are not just tuna and spring water.<br /><br />There is salt in there, too, and it's not healthy sea salt, it's toxic table salt.<br /><br />I am trying to contact Tonnino to confirm that.  I might be wrong because the label states that the ingredients are ""tuna fish"" but the sticker on the top clarifies that it is the smaller (healthier) yellowfin, so the ""salt"" listed in the ingredients might be sea salt but, if it was, why don't they say so?<br /><br />Without confirmation, I will continue to look for a salt-free olive-oil free tuna preserved in glass.<br /><br />If you know of one, please contact me!"
4,1351123200,B001BORBHO,A1AFOYZ9HSM2CZ,5,Happy with the product,My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.
5,1351123200,B008PSM0BQ,A3OUFIMGL2K6RS,4,Good Sauce,"This is a good all purpose sauce.  Has good flavor that the heat doesn't overpower.  Not really that spicy unless you use a whole bunch.  10 good drops is about enough to add a little heat to a pot of soup, but a lot more is needed if you want a lingering burn.  Heat isn't quite up to par with other products out there, (such as Spontaneous Combustion) but this has the true aged cayenne hot sauce flavor."
6,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A9YEAAQVHFUTX,5,Blackcat,Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
7,1351123200,B001KP6B98,ABWCUS3HBDZRS,5,Excellent product,After scouring every store in town for orange peels and not finding anything satisfactory I turned to the online options.<br /><br /> I received the candied orange peels today and I found exactly what I was looking for. The peels are perfect for the fruit cake I plan to bake. The peels are not crystallized with sugar which is great  I like the texture and the taste of the peels and I am gonna order another box soon.

11,1351123200,B004QDA8WC,ANM000BVVUSCT,5,"Exactly what I was looking for: Fast, fantastic Chai!","I was skeptical as to how good an all-in-one Chai Tea for Keurig could be, but my doubts were erased at my first sip!  The spice blend is great, as is the sweetening and the dairy component.  This is the kind of thing I was hoping I could get from my single-serve coffeemaker!<br /><br />Order some, you will thank yourself every time you brew a cup."
12,1351123200,B000K8T3OQ,AK43Y4WT6FFR3,1,Broken in a million pieces,"Chips were broken into small pieces. Problem isn't amazon's, it's Stacy's. Stacy (or amazon) needs to pack the original box of six better, the bags move around too much. There was room for at least two more bags in the box.<br />Amazon packed the Stacy's box in their box very tight and good.<br /><br />I tried to complain to Stacy, they make it very hard, no luck.<br />Chips taste great though, maybe I'll pour them in a bowl with milk for breakfast."
13,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
14,1351123200,B0051C0J6M,AG4YGLLIE8BWP,5,Makes me drool just thinking of them,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"
15,1351123200,B003J9HAU2,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,it's alright,My kitten prefers Kitten Chow or Iams.  He leaves it in his bowl unlike other brands I have purchased in the past.
16,1351123200,B001444G5Q,A3FIA99WOIL40T,2,these are mini candy bars.,I was very disappointed with this order because no where on the description did it say that these were mini candy bars. If you don't want mini's DO NOT BY THIS PACKAGE!!!! Now I have to spend more money because it would cost a ton of money to send these back and I'm not going to give out mini's to trick or treaters.
17,1351123200,B006Q7YG24,A7EU2BWLLCJY2,5,My dogs love them!,"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies."

The cats weren't thrilled with the food, but I stuck with it anyway.  In October, I took one of the cats to vet for weight loss and hair loss.  After various testing, the vet proposed the problem was this food.  I don't know why it made one of the cats so sick and not the others, but I am very upset that I caused my cat to become ill by switching her food.  I am throwing out the rest of this food immediatetly."
25,1351123200,B004F7EFVE,A24UHAYXKSS3AP,5,Yum,My kids love these Earnest Eats snacks. I like that they are more nutritional and healthier that traditional snack bars in the grocery store. I also admire the use non-oil alternative products such as almond butter and non-processed sugar such as dried fruit for sweetness. I have already ordered these bars 3 times and will continue!
26,1351123200,B0011T2SAO,AK0K4RNBQ9NM7,3,Saifun was too thin!,This saifun was very thin and would not "swell" up like other brands of saifun I have used in the past. Had to use three times as much as the usual saifun amounts to make my dishes. Will not buy this again!!

30,1351123200,B001EQ5MT8,A1LZ8VQVNPI30N,5,Better than you-know-who's coffee...,"So my wife is a latte freak, and nursing, so decaf is the approved type.  After the Senseo left the market, I struggled and found the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK"">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> which is like a French Press for the 21st century.  After getting our recipe figured out, my wife, who's been buying Venti Decaf Latte's at $4 a pop almost daily for years now declares that Seattle's best Level 3 Decaf in her home-made Latte is the best coffee she can get.  We've tried other bands, and this is her favorite, hands down!"
31,1351123200,B004X8TGVY,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,5,Like Triscuits but healthier,"We have bought a lot of Kashi Heart to Heart crackers since DH had a heart attack last year, but we've never tried the originals. I didn't realize it, but these are the woven wheat type of cracker like Triscuits, not crackers like the other ones we've been buying. They are not as salty as Triscuits (or they couldn't claim to be heart-healthy), but if you make heart-healthy spreads to put on them using flavorful salt substitutes, you won't miss the salt. They can be used for everything you'd use Triscuits for. I'm really glad these are available."
32,1351123200,B007OSBEV0,A2HE0D04TNG6CS,1,Disappointed,I received the offer from Amazon and had never tried this brand before.  I thought since Martinson's had been in business for a long time that I would order.  I was disappointed.  The flavor was not what I expected and each cup of coffee had a residue in it. I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.
33,1351123200,B003EML8PM,A3VERUHFCZ5S51,5,Ms. Mac's Review,I loved this item.  I wish I could find it in the stores.  Walmart carried this item in Louisiana for some time. When I travel to Louisiana I sometime can find this item at Fred's.  I have not found this item in the Houston area.  Easy to prepare and a great conversation piece.  No one here has seen this before.  I purchased this item at Amazon.
34,1351123200,B007OSBEV0,A2WMWK5GJCY8SH,5,Good coffee.,This is the best Donut Shop Blend out there.  Though most k-cups taste a little freeze dried.  Keurig needs to work on that.  I prefer San Francisco Bay Coffee Company.
35,1351123200,B000VDL7RG,A2QGTXLC93BRV9,4,Good but not as good as I remember,"I could be wrong but it seems like these used to be better. After reading reviews I think something went down in quality once BIGS took over production but with that said, these are still good sunflower seeds and addicting. There was an abundance of seeds that looked like they were smashed together or had gotten a ton of whatever the seasoning was glued onto them in a glob but at least 90% of each package was the normal single seed, non-misformed kind. All in all these are worth buying if you like sunflower seeds but if you have had them before BIGS was outsourced to produce them you may be a little disappointed as I was as they went from great to good."
36,1351123200,B003U9TAH2,A1QA6BI0T8A81I,5,Very good,"It tastes delisious, and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time. Lean body is the suplement with the best flavor I've ever tasted"
37,1351123200,B000FBM3RC,A2XVOWD40JCFSZ,4,yummy cookies!,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
38,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A23E9ZPS2RQZS0,5,Tasty and Quick Pasta,"Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Vegetable Marinara is tasty and has an excellent chunky vegetable marinara.  I just wish there was more of it.  If you aren't starving or on a diet, the 9oz serving is enough for lunch although you might want to add a piece of fruit to feel full.  The whole grain fusilli cooked to al dente tenderness following the instructions and the chunky marinara sauce is so good that I wished there was more of it.  Rarely do I eat sauce alone but this sauce is good enough to."
39,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A3FD3BHIUYIFPD,3,Handy,"Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare."
40,1351123200,B005VUILWI,A1X2LENOF84LCQ,3,sweet enough for me but is not all stevia,"I feel it is sweet enough for me but I am trying to tame my sweet tooth and cutting back on sweets. I don't like that it has the agave in it, It is not something I am interested in using on a regular basis. There is some controversy it seems over how good agave really is for your body. I am looking for a natural sweetener that is good for you and tastes good. I am not completely convinced that this is what I want. Everyone has there own tastes and can make their own decisions. This is just my opinion."
41,1351123200,B005VUILWI,AS44QEHT3KSPK,3,ok....not the best,"I've tried a lot of stevia - not sure why this has agave or silica but then again, the last stevia I bought had lactose listed first, then stevia leaf.<br /><br />The taste is good and it dissovles fast, but I wish it was just pure stevia."
42,1351123200,B003M60630,AJVDF84AZB2OU,5,Celestial Iced Black Tea,This is my favorite brand of black iced tea. I have tried others and they don't compare to the flavor of Celestial Seasons.

44,1351123200,B004SC56MS,A212SRA4Z8BNJY,5,Very pleased,"Good size for my papillon and pomeranian-mix.  These are dense, not airy- so they last longer and from the USA."
45,1351123200,B0076YVPFC,A3OJX18B60PJR9,4,"Tasty & convenient but  at $3.21 a package, not the best value available","Daverat's Wife speaking:  I made this for my husband and it was very easy to prepare in the microwave.  He enjoyed the meal and stated that he'd love to have them on hand if the price point was more reasonable.  He ate his  Fusilla & Veg Marinara with a large salad seasoned only with some balsamic vingar and had it for his dinner meal.  To use the Chinese food cliche, he told me an hour later he was hungry again so I made him a grilled chicken breast.  That got me to thinking that the packaged meal alone wouldn't work for us as a stand-alone  meal.  We'd have to add to it for it to work.  If these were a dollar per package cheaper after Subscribe & Save, they might make a good shelf stable meal to which you could add cooked chicken strips, canned chicken, black beans or even a high quality pouched tuna.  On it's own, it's not filling enough nor nutritionally complete.<br /><br />Right at this moment, Amazon is showing me an offer for a $5 off Amazon coupon which when applied, brings the price point after Subscribe & Save down to $2.38, which is  quite a bit better and rather tempting.  However, after seeing this, I asked my husband if he wanted me to order some for the pantry and suddenly he wasn't as in love with the product any more.  Oh well!  When you add in the cost of a small salad plus some lean protein such as the gilled chicken breast, even with the $5 off, it brings the per meal cost back up to around $4.60.  That may sound like a bargain if you eat out often or grab fast food a few nights a week but we don't.  I plan our meals out for the week and even sometimes for an entire month ahead of time to get the most from every grocery item we buy and I could make this same dish using Barilla High protein pasta, my own vegetable marinara with veg from my gardens and come out quite a bit cheaper.  I also think I could eliminate some of the high sodium contant and bring down the fat in the dish as well.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, however, because hubby liked it, it was simple to prepare and even a starving teenager can toss in some chicken strips of canned chicken to make it a more filling meal.  There's enough sauce in the meal to coat a moderate amount of added chicken or meat.  I could see this being a good pantry staple for a college student or a busy single person. As shelf-stable meals go, even though I wasn't all that impressed with the sodium count and fat, this brand compares quite favorable with other shelf-stable meals. It could be a good choice for folks in ned of something o brag and nuke quickly at the end of a long day and in place of ordering in restaurant food.  For a family on a budget.. not so much of a deal."

I have been trying relentlessly to re-create that experience at home using various products, from clarified butter, to flavacol, to movie butter seasoning.. all of which came close but not exactly it.  After trying the Snappy Butter Burst Oil we agreed this was the closest we've tasted that fit that flavor profile of Authentic Movie Theater Popcorn.  Of course you have remember  to include the other steps as well , like cooking on the stove vs. a hot-air popper and cooking with coconut oil while also using fine-grained salt to top afterwards. (not regular table salt, the fine-grained salt gives much better coverage  ).<br /><br />I could not find any nutritional information on the product so here it is :<br />1 tablespoon Serving Size<br />Total Fat : 14g<br />Saturated Fat: 2g<br />Trans Fatty Fat: 0<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 8g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 4g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 0g<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Ingredients: soybean oil, Artificial Butter Flavor, TBHQ and citric acid, Beta Carotene<br /><br />Suggestion: purchase a pump for use with the gallon size or  , as we like to do,  use a cup with a pouring spout (measuring cup will do),  heat 1 - 2 tablespoons in microwave for 10-15 seconds and slowly pour warmed oil over popped corn ( layering in the popcorn to maximize coverage) .<br /><br />kick back and enjoy your favorite movie,  an episode of your favorite drama, or just enjoy the popcorn all to yourself - whatever suits your mood."
53,1351123200,B001NGAT9W,A111SHKHPDN8N,5,A Hit!,"We had an Autumn soup party a couple of weeks ago, featuring 3 different soups and different artisan breads.  The overwhelmingly favorite soup was the Illinois Prairie Corn Chowder.  It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and I added absolutely nothing to it (except the fresh corn, as recommended on the package) and it tasted fantastic.  Everyone wanted my soup recipe and were surprised when I revealed that it was an easy to make packaged soup.<br /><br />The package makes a lot of soup, about 12 servings.  Since I had a large group, I made up two packages.  We were able to send extra servings home with our guests, and still had plenty left over for ourselves.<br /><br />I saw a review that suggested adding some cooked bacon to the soup.  I'm going to try that next time, even though the package mix requires no extra flavoring.  I just like the flavor of bacon.<br /><br />I'd recommend this soup to anyone who likes corn, chowder, and a rich tasty soup."

Not much more to add<br />if you have read the other positive reviews here about this<br />particular product. Upon placing the order the product arrived<br />8 days later. My only issue was one of the bottles appeared<br />slighty ajar and the oil/liquid had slightly leaked out. The<br />product seemed well packed so I can only assume it may have<br />been roughed up by the delivery company. All things considered<br />giving this product five stars and I highly recommend."

The others have not been opened yet and I found this very upsetting since this is the part the the puppies go for first. I don't mind paying that price if it is as shown. The bag show no white only balls.<br />Theresa Miller
56,1351123200,B0084HNA80,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,3,This price is ridiculous!,"There's nothing wrong with variety, except when it comes at too high a price. If you want variety, go in with a friend on a few of the 9 bags for $26.01 deals that are offered for different flavors of Beanitos.  My favorite are the pinto bean with cheddar cheese variety.  I lost interest very quickly in the black bean and sea salt and chipotle barbecue flavors."

58,1351123200,B00153SS6E,A3EL8POFM0SH1O,5,My precious child (yorkie) REFUSED to eat for 2 months!!!!!,"I have literally been frantic over ""Celli"" (nickname for Andrea Bocelli) not eating anything except treats..no nutritive value..for 2 months!!! I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my ""hero sight"" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought ""Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth""( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!! Now for the happy ending...Celli ate every bit in his bowl as if to say ""This is what I've been waiting for""...Mommy will rest tonight...Thanks Halo and Amazon...My love and gratitude to you!!!"
59,1351123200,B0041CH4I4,A4BFKBO2SU9AX,4,Yummy & Great Small Gift,"If someone who will remain nameless would stop eating all mine, then I wouldn't have had to get the box of 20 Chimes ginger candy tins.  But I'm glad I did.  The packaging is cute, and makes a great small gift to hand out to a co-worker having a rough day, a client when you visit, or a friend when you stop by to watch the game.  The tins are recyclable in most locations.  The individually wrapped candies are made with cane sugar and real ginger, no high fructose corn syrup so they are in a way better for you than other candy options.  Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can settle a stomach and ease hearburn.  When's the last time your chocolate bar did that?"
60,1351123200,B000LVM4EI,ATTK7J5JWVDYD,5,yummy,the best matza balls out there- super yummy with salt. too bad they guy stopped selling them since it was the best price out there.
61,1351123200,B00461CQQU,A2819LG8LK369A,5,Best coffee ever!,"In my opinion this is the best coffee ever!  I've been drinking coffee for 50 plus years and this is what I serve to myself and friends.  However, I wish I could find this grind in a pound size, so I could make a full pot rather than just a single cup."
62,1351123200,B007JFMH8M,A1CHOKV10NEI8X,5,Good cookies.,"Good oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, ""Cookies?"" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, ""No, it's oatmeal"".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
63,1351123200,B0083T6HC0,A3MV6OUJ8WVZ2Z,3,34 unique and one duplicate,"It said 35 different but we got 34 different and a duplicate of the caramel cappuccino. Little disappointed in this. Otherwise it is what it said, a selection of coffee, flavored coffee, decaf, half caf, cider, hot cocoa and tea. I was hoping for the chocolate glazed donut and did not get one but I did get a cinnamon roll k cup."
64,1351123200,B003EM7J9Q,A3VERUHFCZ5S51,5,Ms. Mac's Review,I loved this item.  I wish I could find it in the stores.  Walmart carried this item in Louisiana for some time. When I travel to Louisiana I sometime can find this item at Fred's.  I have not found this item in the Houston area.  Easy to prepare and a great conversation piece.  No one here has seen this before.  I purchased this item at Amazon.
65,1351123200,B000NKHI16,A3TRJP82AD6LXF,5,Excellent! No artificial junk.,"It last longer then most gums today. Plus it doesnt have any artificial coloring, flavor or sweeteners. I also like the green ones."

68,1351123200,B008MOXGKC,A1BCDQAWWZ4JT0,3,Not Syrup,"The product has a good strong ginger flavor and is sweet; it is, however, not syrup. Sweet ginger water would be a more accurate description."
69,1351123200,B0002DGL26,A1QNH9R3AJ1T3K,5,Great product for puppies that are teething!,"This product was great for my teething puppy, who loves to chew everything and anything that he can find.  Definitely a great alternative and he loved all three of the bones."
70,1351123200,B002U5A7U6,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,5,Addictive,"I never cared much for the original Cherry Coke, but I love the new Cherry Zero version. Twelve cans just don't last long around me as I will drink one after another."
71,1351123200,B002GWH9NG,A1U3V5T2YANITN,5,My favorite base coffee for blending,"There are many wonderful and complex flavors that good coffees can offer. This is my mainstay since it has great smooth and rich coffee flavor. It isn't acidy or bitter at all. Actually I like a little acidity so my favorite is to blend this with the Smoked Coffee offered on Coffee Bean Direct's website. Dark Sumatra makes the best base coffee for any blend that I've tried. Costa Rican Tarrazu won't stand on its own but will add just the right amount of acidity to make it my second best choice to blend with Dark Sumatra. If you want to discover the flavorful world of rich coffees, Dark Sumatra is the starting point, then start playing with it."
72,1351123200,B004NRHBBM,A1CXULFGIOT346,5,The best sticky rice out there,"I love Tamanishiki rice, it's some of the best quality rice you can get. True it's a little more expensive, but a large bag like this lasts a while and I find it to be worth the cost for a rice-lover like myself."
73,1351123200,B0009K77O8,A06364072LBY1F3ING9XN,5,"Best Tea, Fast shipping & packed and sealed nicely!","one of the best tea i've ever tasted so far! I had a hard time finding brown rice tea in any supemarket in NH, so i looked @ amazon and got one! If i ran out of tea, i will order more at Yamamotoyama :)"
74,1351123200,B0032GL19S,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,5,"Tasty, and the yogurt coating is a nice addition","While I like yogurt out of a cup, I'm usually not fond of things that are dipped in yogurt. These are the exception - the yogurt coating on the bottom adds a very nice taste to the granola. Sweet, but not candy bar sweet. I prefer the strawberry over the vanilla, but both are good.<br /><br />The granola itself is soft but still holds together as a bar. The calorie count is decent (120 per bar). The nutritional content is not stellar, but reasonably good and much better than candy alternatives.<br /><br />Highly recommend, especially if you can get them on a price dip."
75,1351123200,B0083T6HC0,A3SDC426NPSMQE,1,NOT HAPPY!!,"If I can learn anything from this I have learned~You get what you pay for!! Please, whatever you do, don't get this particular package, because you will be horribly disappointed, unless you want the K-cups no one else would want or drink!! Yes, they are all different, but out of the 35 there I will only be drinking maybe 10 of them, the rest I will try to give away although I doubt anyone will want them!! Alot are decaf, which I don't drink, or they are tea or hot chocolate. I was hoping for actual flavored coffee, now I know to only order my K-cups from Keurig or I will buy them at the store!! I am sadly disappointed in this assortment of K-cups, and the person that packed my bag really did a HORRIBLE job!! Oh, and 4 of them are either empty, or the coffee in them is hard and stale!!"
76,1351123200,B000DZH1D6,A3GV7P0JK4I586,5,Best Ever Cookie,I bought two cases of the Pecan Shortbread cookies since I can't find them in the grocery store anymore. The other flavors are not so good. These are a great value when you combine with free shipping. They have a very good taste and you wouldn't even guess that they are a gluten free cookie. My shipment arrived unbroken but I have bought in the store and they were crumbs. I love this product.
77,1351123200,B004EDHD1I,APPNN3ALT0ME2,5,Great alternative to daily Starbucks trips,"My wife and I are big fans of hot morning drinks (with caffeine), especially in the winter. We realized this to be a great way for us to get our morning fix more affordably from home. It's been about a year now and somehow this ""flavor"" tea hasn't gotten old yet!"
78,1351123200,B0047462NO,A1JWY18IISLJZA,5,Perfect Bloody Mary Supplies,"It's the best bloody mary mix. And this is the perfect size. Enough for 1 or 2 drinks--you'll never throw any away. Maybe not the best size if you're mixing up a pitcher, but if you're just making a couple to half a dozen or so, this is great. Shipped well and lives nicely in the garage until called into action."

81,1351123200,B0029XLH4Y,A2CSPTFY7QPT78,5,Great bold taste-- compare to Emeril's Bold,"I've been drinking Emeril's Bold for a year and a half, and wanted to try something different. A review led me to this brand, and I love it too! I'm a strong coffee gal-- I like Starbuck's-- so this is right up my alley."
82,1351123200,B0029XLH4Y,A3NIBMLKUK73JC,5,Great flavor no bite,This coffee is a favorite of mine and many others. Jet Fuel is dark roasted but smooth and rich with no bite!
83,1351123200,B008HF0KS2,AWFA8N9IXELVH,1,Deceptive description,On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
84,1351123200,B008ADQOL8,A1YYFX661KECLP,5,Incredible matcha!,This matcha is incredible - I got hooked on plain matcha - so having someone kick it up a notch and add this incredible flavour is amazing.  I'm a big Boston Cream donut fan and this has the same taste too it.  Highly recommend it!

86,1351123200,B0083T6HC0,A20BV8REQQXB8R,5,VERY HAPPY!!!,"I ordered on the 23rd and it was deliverd 2 days later. It was in a brown paper bag, but placed in a box. I had 35 exactly and only 1 repeat. People complained of too much decaf or half-caff which I would like but only had 3 of those. Only two hot cocoa and two spiced cider. I loved the variety and looking forward to a whole new variety next time I order; and I will order again."
87,1351123200,B003CIBPN8,A2CUGPQKBWYTQH,5,Great taste!,The best coconut water...it is much better in the bottle than the paper box. I would recommend it. It even tastes great at room temperature.
88,1351123200,B000E3ZFDU,A1PQDL14230X6U,5,Delicious!,"I enjoy this white beans seasoning, it gives a rich flavor to the beans I just love it, my mother in law didn't know about this Zatarain's brand and now she is traying different seasoning and she likes it very much.<br />Thank you Amazon for having it because now I can't find it in stores, I like to have this 12 boxes because I can made it whenever my family want it."
89,1351123200,B0034EDMCW,A1XV4W7JWX341C,5,"Ordered these bars for my daughter in college who's on the go...will re-order for both of us, they are soooo yummy & HEALTHY!",These Kind Bars are so good and healthy & gluten free.  My daughter came across them and loves them for a quick snack between her hectic schedule of classes & work. Most times she won't have time to eat a full meal and these are such a great alternative to fast food.  I will order again & this time I'll get a few for moi! Really loved the cranberry too..
90,1351123200,B005DGIAMQ,A1PZONL4WESG1W,4,My Pit Loves It,This Nylabone chew-toy stick is great for my pit.  She loves to chew things but gets tired of the regular shaped bones.  This Nylabone stick is perfect.  It's durable and my pit likes the hollow stick-shape for some reason.  I think the bacon scent also attracts her.  I definitely would recommend this toy for anybody that has a big dog that loves to chew!
91,1351123200,B005DGIAMQ,AW7RYHDFTRUXM,4,Nylabone DuraChes,"Not as hard as the white Nylabone chews but my chewer likes it better. It clearly will last a long time. The cavity for placing food products is not useful as cleaning it is problematic and as it becomes chewed, is difficult to insert stuff. Overall it is a good chew stick."
92,1351123200,B0065AOUKK,A3KK7HD497XU5Z,5,will do it again,Service was great. Hot White Chocolate is awesome. I will be ordering again soon!! Even the family is hooked and wants some more to.
93,1351123200,B000YSTGGW,AQH6FCS9F0Z9R,1,Makes babies constipated!,"Wrongful advertisement! I usually don't write any reviews but I had to give this one a star. Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her ""full diaper""! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop, I tried prunes and this product is still sitting in her little tummy. Waste of money! Disappointed in whole foods that they would sell such a bad product!"
94,1351123200,B000KV7ZGQ,A281J4UAH70YBA,5,Fantastic for energetic big pups,"My 70 lb Shepard/boxer mix absolutely loves her tug-a-jug. It takes her about 20-30 mintues to finish a cup's worth of kibbles. She's had it for about 5 months, and has yet to get tired of it. Also it's really held up well."
95,1351123200,B0041KMB2U,A1DDY9Q3462A3O,5,Dat'l Do It spicy Pepper Sauce,"This sauce is hot, tasty and spicy! Much hotter than other Datil pepper sauces, and full of smokey flavor, like a bar-b-que sauce with a kick! I love it!"
96,1351123200,B000GZS9U2,A2H8FXK339OE5N,5,musical fruit,"Perfect pantry basic on the non meat protein shelf.  Long shelf life,  mixes well in many soups and stews and free of many contaminents.  It is good for you and versatile."
